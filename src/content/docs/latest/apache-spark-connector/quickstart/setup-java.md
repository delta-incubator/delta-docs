As mentioned in the official Apache Spark installation instructions [here](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/index.html#downloading), make sure you have a valid Java version installed (8, 11, or 17) and that Java is configured correctly on your system using either the system `PATH` or `JAVA_HOME` environmental variable.

Windows users should follow the instructions in this [blog](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-spark-on-windows-10), making sure to use the correct version of Apache Spark that is compatible with Delta Lake `3.3.0`.
